# Crystal Collector
Four crystals are displayed as buttons on the page. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player’s total score. There is no telling the value of a crystal until after it is clicked. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game keeps track of wins and losses, and automatically resets after each round, so don’t refresh the page!
